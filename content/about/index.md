Hello!  In case you were curious about the author, I'm into software
development, soccer, information retrieval, long walks on the beach, poetry,
talking about feelings, the spanish language, coffee, travelling, formerly
indie bands that have long since sold out, and making up inane lists of
interests of which only 75% are actually true.  This blog covers some subset of
these.

Eagle-eyed web page readers might be wondering "What is a random walker"? A
random walk is a routing technique used in peer-to-peer networks where a peer
randomly selects a neighbor to forward a message to (think Billy's routes in
Family Circus). Its mostly just an inside joke with myself.
