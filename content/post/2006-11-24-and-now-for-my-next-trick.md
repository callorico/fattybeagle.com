I'm sure my vast reading audience is wondering what I am doing now. The current
plan is to attend a Spanish language school in Spain. Why Spanish? Mainly for
travel reasons. Knowing some would be useful in Spain, South America, and
Mexico (and southern California). But truthfully, the real reason is that one
of my pet peeves is when two people will make little side comments to each
other in a different language right in front of you. My dream is to be able to
catch someone making a snide statement and call them on it. Is this a rather
petty and bitter dream? Well yes, but I am a petty and bitter person. Of
course, this trick doesn't work if you look like you might speak the language
in question. For example, it's not so surprising if the Asian guy speaks an
Asian language (yes, I'm lumping all Asians into one category. [All look
same][1]. Bite me). Its a lot better to be the White guy who speaks fluent
Chinese.

This should be quite the challenge since frankly, I am absolutely terrible at
picking up foreign languages. I'm no good at memorizing things. In Japanese
class, I would immediately forget everything as soon as I finished taking the
test.

There appear to be no shortage of adult language schools in Spain. I am dearly
hoping that the school I have registered at is reputable and that I don't end
up being sold into porn (Este 'estudiante' tiene una boca bonita...)

Here's my itinerary for the stalkers out there:

**Jan 7 - Jan 27:** Tenerife

 **Jan 28 - Feb 17:** Granada

 **Feb 18 - Mar 17:** Barcelona

 **Mar 17 - Mar 25:** Meeting a buddy in Italy (Rome, Florence, ?)
