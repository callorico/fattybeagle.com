Well, I'm back in lovely Seattle (where'd all the leaves go?). Gotta say, it
has been a blast. Not that trips should be about completing checklists or
anything but for the curious:

  * Number of days: 32
  * Total miles: 7789
  * Number of friend's couches slept on: 2
  * Number of states: 16 (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, South
    Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico,
    Arizona, Nevada, California)
  * Number of national parks: 7 (Yellowstone, Wind Cave, Badlands, Petrified
    Forest, Grand Canyon, Saguaro, Death Valley)
  * Number of caves: 3 (Wind Cave, Meramec, Grand Canyon Caverns)
  * Number of postcards: 57

The postcards actually have the nice pictures of some of the places I visited.
Ya'll are free to come and look at them anytime if you are curious. I'm going
to try and get a map posted of my route before I forget.
