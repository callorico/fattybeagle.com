I guess mainly because I really find the architecture quite stunning. Then
again, I'm not exactly well travelled so maybe every city in Europe looks like
this. However, I'm pretty sure that those crazy, almost cartoonish Gaudi
buildings are fairly unique. Love the tiny twisty roads in Barri Gotic (not
quite as twisty turny as Albayzin but still fun). Seems like I find a new plaza
everytime I walk through that barrio. Lots of interesting towers and statues
all over town. Lots and lots of freakishly talented skaters. Lots of dogs.

I like seeing and hearing Catalan all over the place as it serves to
differentiate the region and adds a bit of mystery (especially when trying to
order food). To my untrained ear, the language doesn't sound quite as smooth as
Spanish. It seems like there are a lot of words that end with a hard T sound
("ciutat" instead of "ciudad" for example). And coincidentally, I have seen
"catalonia no es españia" graffitti around town. After having noticed similar
sentiment in the Canaries as well as Andalucia, this begs the question: "¿Qué
es españia?"

Lots and lots of museums. Loved the [Killing Machine][1] exhibition at the
contemporary art museum near the University of Barcelona. The Picasso Museum is
a definite must see if only for the [Las Meninas][2] exhibit. Definitely need
to buy a print when I get back. There is also an interesting history museum
that goes under the city and lets you walk along the remains of the old Roman
town that Barcelona is built over (Man, Barcelona totally ripped off the
Seattle Underground Tour).

Lots of rabid soccer fans. I finally got to see one of the world's most famous
clubs, FC Barça, in one of the better soccer leagues, in one of the most famous
stadiums in Europe (Camp Nou). [Y ademas, ¡vi el jugador con una cara como un
caballo en persona!][3] The guy sitting next to me at the game was literally
quivering with delight and making strange whelping noises every single time
Barça made a positive play.

The city is along the water and I'm a big sucker for that. And, Barçelona is
bike friendly to boot. I find that I generally tend to like cities that have
bike lanes (well, in the US anyway).
