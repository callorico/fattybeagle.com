I made it as far as Needles, CA but decided to forego the final leg of Route
66. I detoured north because Death Valley National Park sounded interesting and
the weather there is actually bearable at this time of year (it was in the
90's). Plus, I've already been to Los Angeles and the Santa Monica pier.

While there are sand dunes in Death Valley, there were a lot more mountains and
rock formations than I expected. It was very scenic but I've become obsessed
with sand dunes and caverns for some reason so I was a little disappointed. I
think there are some sand dunes in southern Oregon. I intend to check those
out.

From Death Valley, I headed west and the current plan is to drive back to
Washington up the Pacific coast. It was a thrill to first smell the sea air and
then finally see the big blue (well, brown in this part of the state) ocean
since I've been in land locked states for quite a while now. I think the fact
that it was just physically impossible to drive any farther West provides a
certain sense of completion.

I've been on US 1 with my family back in the day and I really only have one
memory of it. I recall my mom and brother being nauseous and asleep in the back
seat of the rental car while I was sort of dozing off in the front. I then
distinctly remember my father not taking the 15 MPH turn sign seriously,
skidding on the gravel along the shoulder of the road, and very nearly plunging
the car into the ocean many hundreds of feet down below.

I was pretty wide awake the rest of the drive.
