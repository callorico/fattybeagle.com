I've been using Microsoft Streets & Trips 2006 for route planning purposes and
it has been working pretty well aside from the random crashes (restarting the
app while driving isn't easy!) and occasionally incorrect directions. There is
a GPS trail feature that plots out the path that the dongle is taking. It would
be nice if I could further exploit the trail information.

  1. I would like to be able to create some kind of script to auto-update a
     website with the latest trail to allow others to track my location. I have
     been surprised at how often the laptop has inadvertantly connected to a
     wireless network even when driving around small towns. I think I can
     accomplish this manually by saving an image of the map with the GPS trail
     and uploading it but that is a tad bit tedious.
  2. The other thought is that the GPS trail could be used as a poor man's
     geotagging system by matching photo timestamps with the GPS location on
     the trail with the corresponding timestamp. This wouldn't be entirely
     accurate if you leave your car, go hiking, and take the picture 10 miles
     away but the accuracy would be good enough for me. However, I don't think
     you can export the trail information and it probably isn't trivial to
     reverse engineer the file format Streets & Trips is using. While there are
     camera phones and digital cameras with embedded GPS units, I have rather
     antiquated equipment and would find this useful as I am forgetting where
     exactly I have taken a picture in the first place.
