Frankly, it wasn't much to look at. But, the people at the local bar were
friendly and wondering why the hell I decided to stop in SC. Apparently the
town is affectionately known as "Sewer City" because of its proximity to a meat
packing plant. Thankfully, I didn't notice any smell. I guess the cold front
following me has been good for something.

Doug told me he lived in Port Angeles for 3 months which seemed an awfully
short time to live in a place after moving that far. I didn't press for
details. Luke, a former school teacher from Texas turned US Marshall gleefully
showed me the scar on his elbow he received after busting a car side mirror
while wresting a suspect to the ground. Good times, I liked em both.

And best of all, everybody here seemed to hate the Chicago Bears. Now that's
something I can get behind. ðŸ™‚
