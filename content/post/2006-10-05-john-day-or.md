Met up with the parents in Portland and weaseled three free meals out of them.
From there, I headed east on Highway 26.

I detest taking pictures but any that I do take will be posted [here][1].

Virtually every road sign on the way into John Day had at least one bullet hole
in it. One was even peppered with shotgun pellets. And so while looking for a
place to stay, I decided to pass on the slightly run down looking inn with the
giant "Hunters Welcome!" banner on the balcony. I also passed on the one with
the "Bikers Welcome!" sign and ended up a rather unexciting Best Western. Of
course, finding a place with a TV was a must since the season premiere of Lost
was on.

Next stop: Boise
