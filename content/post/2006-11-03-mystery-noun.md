One of the rules I have is that I must stop at any attraction that has the word
"Mystery" in it. Admittedly, this approach has had mixed results thus far:

  * Mystery Castle, Phoenix, AZ: Unfortunately it wasn't open so I could only
    look at it from afar. Looked awfully mysterious from the parking lot
    though.
  * Mystery Spot, Santa Cruz, CA: There is a book in the gift shop claiming
    that the effects are due to some sort of gravitational paradox hoohah.
    Whatever. Not sure how it works but the illusion is convincing. Objects
    appear to roll uphill and people change height when standing on different
    ends of supposedly level wooden planks. Definitely worth seeing if only for
    the free bumper sticker.
  * Trees of Mystery, Klamath, CA: Impressive redwoods with unusual shapes and
    some elaborate wood sculptures. To be honest however, the giant Paul Bunyan
    and Babe the Blue Ox statues in the front and the big neon "Live Burls"
    sign in the gift shop were the highlight. I did meet my bizzaro-world twin
    from Pennsylvania on the gondola ride up to the observation deck. She
    apparently quit her engineering job and is currently on a long (2 month!)
    road trip doing the exact same route as me except in reverse. How
    mysterious!
