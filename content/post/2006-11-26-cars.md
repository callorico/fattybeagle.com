Rented the latest Pixar movie the other day. I was pleasantly surprised to see
that they worked several Route 66 landmarks into Radiator Springs. I'm sure
there are a bunch more but the ones I noticed were:

  * The "[Here It Is][1]" sign makes an appearance with a car instead of a
    jackrabbit.
  * The traffic cone motel is a send-up of the [Wigwam Village][2]. Darn, I
    definitely regret not staying the night there. Also, the "100% Refrigerated
    Air" neon sign is from the [Blue Swallow Motel][3] in Tucumcari, NM.

UPDATE: Of course, [this post][4] pretty much covers everything in a much more
complete fashion.
