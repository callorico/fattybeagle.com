I will preface this with a confession that I mostly just read pulpy trash so
I'm not much of a literary critic. Whenever I see [one][1] of [those lists][2]
of the [100 greatest novels of all time][3], I'm always a little disheartened
at how few of those books I have read.

[On The Road][4] tends to show up in these and I picked up a copy a while back
to both broaden my reading horizons and to serve as inspiration before leaving
on my road trip. Unfortunately, I didn't actually get around to reading it
until after I returned.

Having finished it, I can safely say that I am a complete pussy (shocking, I
know) and the amount of hitchhiking, drugs, women, and booze that those guys
did was the pretty much the complete antithesis of my trip (also shocking, I'm
sure). Man, those guys were the beatest! I suspect that their more staid,
corporate-ladder climbing peers of their generation would probably label them
'degenerates' instead. But, the contrast between these guys and the
Leave-It-To-Beaver-Wholesome-All-American-Family that I always picture as the
mainstream from that era is a trip because being all counterculture is like,
cool and stuff, ya know?

Kerouac does a fantastic job of capturing the feeling of wanderlust and the
need to just GTFO sometimes. I can definitely relate to this but they just take
it to a whole 'nother level. Kerouac and his whole crew just lived hard, fast,
and flat out _interesting_ lives. Of course both he and his road buddy Neal
Cassady died young but shit, there's a fine line between madness and being
interesting right?

Anyway, starred review, two thumbs up, and all that jazz. Go read it if you are
an unread heathen like me. Unless of course you hate hippies (and I know some
of you do).
