Changed my return ticket to spend a few days in London. Trying to enter the
country was interesting though since there was a colossal prick at the customs
line. Note to self: Mentioning that you are unemployed and trying to enter
Britain is apparently a huge problem. The agent seemed to be convinced that I
was going to try and work illegally. After going over the details of my trip he
demanded to see my return ticket to the US. I tried to explain it was
electronic-only and that I don't have a hard copy on me. He then asked me how
much money I have in my bank accounts and things really started going downhill
when I responded with "enough to pay for this trip". He got awfully pissy at
that point and started threatened to charge me with a felony if I didn't answer
his question and then said I was foolish for for not having official documents
on me indicating my net worth. Right. He then made me pull out my leftover
euros (for what reason I have no idea) and show him my ATM card that I intended
to use to withdraw British pounds. Whatever. Hope you enjoyed your power trip,
you asshole.
