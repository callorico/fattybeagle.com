I decided that I had better go and check out some of the local bands this past
weekend. However, I found it surprisingly difficult to locate a good concert
listing. The listings I did find seemed unusually sparse. I swear there must be
more shows in a city this size but I suppose I am not sufficiently indie to
sniff them out.

Double billing at [Sidecar][1] on Friday.

  * [Chest][2] &#8211; Well, they tried hard and certainly looked the part but
    the vocals and hooks just weren't there for a power pop band. Thumbs down.
  * [Chicos del Sabado][3]. Much better than the opening band. Thought they
    were a bit Ramones-esque.

And then I went to another show at [[2]][4] on Sunday.

  * [We Are Balboa][5]. Pretty rocking. A bit of a cross between Visqueen and
    Goodness. Helps that the cantante es bastante guapa tambien. Sweet little
    cover of Under Pressure. Bonus points for the venue being relatively smoke
    free.

Unfortunately, with all the trappings of a big city come the associated costs.
Barcelona is much more expensive than Granada and Tenerife. 5 euro for a beer
seems to be typical at the trendier joints. Its a bit tough to swallow after
you convert to dollars.
