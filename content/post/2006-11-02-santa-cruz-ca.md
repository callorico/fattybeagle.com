I'm such a sucker for beach boardwalks and for that reason I really enjoyed
Santa Cruz. I think its the oldest amusement park on the West Coast and
according to the banners, is currently celebrating its 100 year anniversary. I
was looking forward to riding the Giant Dipper, an old style wooden roller
coaster, but unfortunately it was closed until the weekend. Ah well, that's the
downside to traveling in the off-season I suppose.

However, I am docking the boardwalk a couple of points. One for having a
concrete boardwalk instead of wood. I mean, does it really make sense to call
it a boardwalk if there aren't any planks of wood? It loses another point for
still being a popular attraction. Coney Island remains my favorite primarily
because there is something nostalgic about the faded glory of it. You can get
some faint glimpses of what it must have been like in its heyday by looking at
the old buildings and comparing them to their former selves in old photos.
Plus, it has a bit of an edge to it and doesn't feel quite as safe and
family-friendly. Shoot The Freak anyone?
