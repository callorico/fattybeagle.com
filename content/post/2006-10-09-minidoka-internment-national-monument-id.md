I took a spur-of-the-moment detour to look at the [Minidoka Internment
Camp][1]. The visitor center is located about 20 miles away from the actual
site and there's virtual no signage so its not the easiest place to find. It
really is a dusty and desolate place. I pulled up to a rather old, run down
looking building that vaguely resembled military barracks. As I was thinking to
myself, "Oh man, I can't believe they were forced to live in..." I noticed a
satellite TV dish attached to the corner of the building and cars parked in the
driveway. It then dawned on me that I was on somebody else's private property.
The monument was actually on the other side of the street. Oops.
