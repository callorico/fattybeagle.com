You know that old saying about how "its the journey, not the destination that's
important"? I'm fairly convinced the person who said that has never driven
across the Midwest. After leaving the wondrous Wall Drug on I-90, the
billboards thinned out and I was left with nothing but the mind-numbing tedium
of the interstate. I took a detour south on US-83 and then east on US-20 which
was a glorious 2-lane diversion but eventually US-20 widens out to 4 lanes.
Ugh.

There wasn't much to listen to on the radio either. There were 3 AM stations
playing the exact same Rush Limbaugh show simultaneously. Somewhat ironically,
the station carrying Hannity also broadcasts Air America shows later in the
day.

I ended up settling on the Agriculture Radio Network. I didn't understand a
word of it but listening to an analyst discussing soybean futures likely
filling the gap left by corn and then speculating about the South American bean
derivative market was oddly fascinating.
