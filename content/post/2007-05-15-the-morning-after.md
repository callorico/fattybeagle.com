  So you know that dreadful feeling you get on that first day back to work
  after a long vacation? Yeah, it really is that much worse when your
  'vacation' is 7 months. And so, the oh-so-rapid forgetting process has
  already begun and I expect in another few weeks my mediocre Spanish will drop
  to the non-existent level and details of the trip itself will be lost in the
  alcohol drenched nether regions of my gray matter.
