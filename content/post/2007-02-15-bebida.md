Among the more disturbing things I've witnessed in Spain (besides the lack of a
scoop law for dog owners) is the widespread popularity of vino tinto verano
which is a drink consisting of cheap red wine mixed with either lemonade soda
or Sprite. I guess its a really economical way to get borracho but really, only
17 year old girls should be drinking this stuff, not 60-year old men. Blech.
