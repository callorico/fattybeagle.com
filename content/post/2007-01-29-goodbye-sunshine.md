And so I have bid a fond farewell to the Canary Islands and am currently in
Granada where the weather is suspiciously Seattle-like except with more rain.
Before arriving here, I spent slightly less than a day in Madrid since I
couldn't find a direct flight to Granada from Tenerife. Of course, that's not
nearly enough time to scratch the surface of the city. I did a quick walkthough
of Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor where I saw an endless stream of tourists and
a guy begging for change with no arms by holding a cup with his mouth. But
alas, the police quickly shepherded him out of the area lest the visitors think
there are homeless crazy people in the city. Definitely a shame that I didn't
have time to really see anything and I hope to return someday.

My packing plan appears to have backfired a bit since the airlines here have a
rather strict weight and size limit for carryons as well as checked luggage (10
kg). Unfortunately, with my laptop and the books I've picked up from school,
I'm about 3 or 4 kilos over the limit which means I need to check my bag. Bah.
Even more unfortunate is the fact that my laptop is on the verge of death. It
appears to be some kind of hardware problem and I get random BSODs and it even
fails to post sometimes. Ughh, nothing like having to carry around a 4 lbs
paperweight for the next couple of months. Que lastima.

Finally, I'm not entirely sure what this thing is. I've seen it in every place
I have stayed thus far (and haha funny guy, its not the toilet I'm referring
to).
