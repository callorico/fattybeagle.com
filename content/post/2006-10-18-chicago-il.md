Boy, Chicago sure is, well, windy. I only spent a day here but it really does
seem like a great city. The architectural mix of old and new buildings in the
Loop is fantastic. I did drive through Cicero which I think used to be a
mobster hotspot. I confess that I was a little disappointed not to see any
gangsters with tommy guns walking down the street.

There was some unprecedented October snowfall (2 feet!) in western NY that
felled a bunch of trees and took out the power. Since I heard reports saying it
could be days or weeks before normalcy was restored, I decided to abandon my
plans of seeing Niagara Falls and Boston and started heading back West on Route
66.
