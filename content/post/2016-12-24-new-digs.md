I decided to finally move all of my embarassingly old and obsolete posts from
WordPress to a shiny new static site. It is amusing to see static sites
back in vogue again but it makes a lot sense when you consider the ongoing
security and management hassles associated with hosting your own WP site.
The client-side tooling has improved a lot as well. The workflow of using a
local text editor, running a simple publish script, and versioning everything
with git is pretty nice.

I ended up using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and everything is hosted on
S3/Cloudfront. The free TLS is a fair tradeoff for the relatively minimal
amount of AWS lock-in this type of site entails. I considered using Let's
Encrypt but didn't want to go through the extra hassle of setting up automation
to renew the cert every 90 days.

Now, if only I can keep the posts on the front page to be from within the last
half-decade...
