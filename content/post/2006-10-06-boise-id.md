I was pleasantly surprised with Boise. There's a nice, small, very walkable
downtown core with a bunch of coffee shops, restaurants, and bars. Feeling
inspired after noticing several hip indie kids around town (Boise State
University is nearby), I grabbed a copy of the Boise Weekly to see if there
were any shows.

I ended up at the Bouquet. While waiting for the show to start I met an older
couple, Terry and Anne, who apparently just sold their house in McCall to buy a
new RV. They told me they spend most of the year in Mexico and then travel
around the US during the summer when it gets too hot. When I told them I was
from Seattle, Anne exclaimed: "Oh, I thought so. You just look **so** Seattle."
Now, I'm dying to replay that conversation and stick in a different city to see
what she would say.

The band, Crashfour, was pretty meh. I really wanted to like them when I saw
that one of the members played a violin but they were pretty underwhelming.
They sounded a tad like a poor man's Left Hand Smoke. Ah well, Thursday night
show, what can you expect?

Hmm, perhaps Anne detected my music snobbery when deciding I was from Seattle.
