Thought I'd try and enumerate some of the End Of The World TV shows and books
that I can think of off the top of my head:

There's at least a couple episodes of The Twilight Zone that touch on this:

  * [Where Is Everybody?][1] &#8211; Not sure I agree with the whole "no man is
    an island" bit but perhaps the fact that I virtually never suffer bouts of
    loneliness would be a strength should there be an upcoming apocalypse.
  * [Time Enough At Last][2] &#8211; I can relate to the bookish guy in this
    one a little better in that all those societal distractions can be awfully
    annoying sometimes. You know stuff like work, talking to your wife, etc.
    Sure would be nice if everybody just kind of went away for a while. Of
    course, I'm guessing there probably wouldn't be high speed intarweb in this
    new empty world and I'd probably end up suffering a similar fate as our
    lucky protagonist.

There are a ton of books out there. Feel free to offer suggestions!

  * [Oryx and Crake][3] &#8211; Cautionary tale about the ramifications of
    genetic engineering. Love the pigoons ([ruh-roh][4]) and the bit where the
    characters wonder whether or not it would even be possible to rebuild
    society again. You know, I think we've consumed so many nonrenewable
    resources and technology requires such incredible specialization these
    days, we wouldn't be able to unless a vast repository of knowledge remained
    intact somewhere. (Actually, wait a minute, now I'm not sure if that little
    discussion was even in this book.)
  * [The Stand][5] &#8211; A classic and probably my favorite Stephen King
    book. Your typical catastrophic human engineered virus wipes out everybody
    which sets up a ginormous battle between the survivors split into good and
    evil camps. All the little ties to the Dark Tower series are fun too.
  * [I Am Legend][6] &#8211; A cheery little vampire story. Again, its
    enjoyable because its a recognizable modern town, except devoid of people.
  * [Swan Song][7] &#8211; An 956 page steaming pile of shit. Ridiculously
    shallow and one-dimensional characters and filled with trite, incredibly
    cheesy prose. I suppose people might say the same thing about King but I've
    always thought he was good at getting into his characters' heads and
    sheesh, I like to read trash. But seriously, this one is really bad even by
    my standards.

It also occurs to me that I also need to read [The Road][8]. The fact that this
is an Oprah book is a bit worrisome however. Must be the whole father/son
bonding thing. I should be able to pick it up any day now from the library
since I'm all the way up to #145 on the waiting list. Damn that Oprah!
