In a word: Primal. Although I've heard the hydrothermal activity has really
calmed down over the years it is still impressive. There are elevated walkways
around the Mammoth Hot Springs and Old Faithful areas that you are supposed to
walk on. With the primordial sulphur fumes and boiling liquid, I was suddenly
reminded of "[A Sound of Thunder][1]" by Bradbury and I did not dare step off
the path...
