The sheer enormity of the canyon just smacked me in the face when approaching
from the South Rim. The road gave no indication of what was coming until I was
right at the edge of the rim. The first sighting of it really left me
struggling to comprehend its magnitude.

I snapped a few photos but the flat 2D images are unsatisfying. It really is a
very visceral experience that can't be adequately captured by a camera. As a
further example of the canyon's size I took a brief day hike on the [South
Kaibab Trail][1] to Skeleton Point. Even though the trail descends 2000 feet,
everything looks just as far away as it does from the rim. In my opinion, it's
definitely not worth hiking the canyon unless you go all the way to the bottom
because the slog back out is a bitch.
