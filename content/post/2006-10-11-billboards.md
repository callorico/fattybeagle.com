There are those that find billboards offensive but I for one enjoy them for
their tackiness so long as they are for local businesses.

  * Saw first Wall Drug sign just outside of Shoshoni, WY (418 miles away).
    Surprised that I haven't seen one earlier actually. I have read stories
    about signs in Antarctica.
  * And close by, a billboard for "Microsurgery Vasectomy Removal". Didn't
    realize there was such a big market for that here.
  * Not technically a billboard but I got a kick out of the sign for the town
    of Van Tassell, WY: Population 18.

And yes, Wall Drug is pretty much the most awesome thing ever. I grabbed my
free bumper sticker, sign, and 5 cent cup o' coffee. Didn't seem to be any cups
for the free ice water though.
