He warned me but I didn't believe him.

I mean, how bad could Glendale be? Oh, how wrong I was. Glendale takes the
thing I hate about Phoenix, the city sprawl, and combines it with a rather
trashy looking population. While I'm sure there are cool places to visit, they
are well hidden by the cookie cutter strip malls that adorn every block.

No matter, the mission was to verify that my buddy BK's new girlfriend was in
fact a real person. I am pleased to report that she was indeed flesh and blood
and quite personable to boot. Ah, such a cute interracial couple. I can't wait
to be invited to the wedding and eventually meet their cute hapa kids. But
perhaps I am getting ahead of myself with my cute thoughts.

Since the excitement of Glendale was a bit too much for the ole' heart to take,
I passed on sightseeing and pretended I was an MBA student for a day. BK's GF
was nice enough to ask her professor if I could sit in on her class. To
complete the deception, I had a beer or 6 with some of his buddies afterwards
at the school bar. So, while the town may suck, at least BK's friends were
interesting and I now know some of the factors leading to corruption in less
developed countries. Yay!

BK and I did take a daytrip to the Tuscon area and visited the Arizona-Sonora
Desert Museum which I greatly enjoyed and would heartily recommend. Don't order
the hotdogs though.
