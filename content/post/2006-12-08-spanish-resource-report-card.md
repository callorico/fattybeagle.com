Some grades for the different resources I have used in my attempt to learn
Spanish.

**[Pimsleur Spanish I][1], [II][2], [III][3]** _(A)_. Great stuff. They do a
really good job of repeating older material to keep you from forgetting
previous lessons. My only gripe is that the way in which words are introduced
seems a little random sometimes. For example, I have no idea why they would
bother teaching me how to say "engineer". Some of the conversations are
priceless though:

"I'm going to drink 3 beers."

"In half an hour?"

"I like beer."

I really like the series but the main problem is that I have no idea how to
write or read anything which led me to purchase the following book.

[**Spanish: The Easy Way**][4] _(C-)_. Generally, I am a little hesitant to buy
books with these types of titles. You know, the "Learn C++ In 7 Minutes" type
of book. I mean, if it was really that easy everybody would do it during that 5
minute half-asleep/half-awake window before finally dozing off and there
wouldn't be a frigging giant row of books on the subject. See now, if someone
wrote a book called "Spanish: This Shit Is Hard", I'd be all over that. Of
course, it's not fair to judge a book by its cover and I'm sure the content is
actually fabulous in some of these. I got this one mainly because the layout
looked nice and there were a lot of pictures.

But unfortunately, this book kind of blows. My main gripe is that the answers
in the back sometimes seem to be referring to a completely different question
(although perhaps I am just truly clueless). This is a little disappointing
considering that this is the 4th edition. Sometimes the answers require
grammatical knowledge that hasn't been introduced yet. Also annoying is that
some of the blank spaces in the exercises are about this long \____ and you are
supposed to write in an uber long answer.
