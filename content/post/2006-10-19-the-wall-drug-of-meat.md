I stopped for lunch at The Big Texan Steak Ranch in Amarillo, TX. Here, your
meal is free if you can consume a 72oz steak and all of the fixings in an hour.
You don't get to make the attempt in private either. Instead, your feat of
gluttony takes place on an elevated platform in the center of the restaurant
with a giant digital timer in the background. The place just reeks of awesome.
There are deer and bighorn ram heads lining the railings of the 2nd floor. Not
content being solely a restaurant, there are also two Big Texan motels on the
other side of the parking lot: one for people and another for horses. Throw in
a giant cow statue and limos with bull horns on the hood and you have a perfect
example of the Route 66 kitsch experience.
