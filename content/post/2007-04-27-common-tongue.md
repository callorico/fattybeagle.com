I'm sure this is a hugely unpopular sentiment, but honestly, I would prefer if
the entire world spoke a common language ([Esperanto][1] anyone?). Of course, I
think these auxiliary languages generally face a chicken and egg problem when
it comes to gaining traction amongst the general population. Why bother
learning it if nobody else speaks it?

See, for me, a language is solely for communication. Sure there might be some
subtle nuances you can't describe in another language or there might be a nice
rhythmic flow or sound to the language. But really, I don't care. I think just
about any language can handle 99.9% of your modern daily needs just fine.

While in Barcelona I tried explaining this to my teacher and he responded to
this by saying that he could understand my attitude since I live in a colony. I
don't know what it is like to live in a place where a language was born. Fair
enough, I never really thought about it like this but I suppose he's right. I
don't feel any special affinity towards English. He went on to say that he
hates it when people use English words when there is an equivalent in Spanish.
He sees it as a contamination of the language. I'm going to extrapolate from
this and assume that he doesn't really care for the Spanish in use in Latin
America (where a computer is called a computadora instead of an ordenador and a
car is a carro instead of a coche, for example).

I find this somewhat ironic since as far as I understand this "contamination"
is exactly how Spanish was born in the first place. Way back in the day, there
were a select few well educated aristocrats that could speak and write the
Latin language correctly and then there was the incorrect Latin that the
unwashed masses spoke. These differences in these dialects slowly became larger
and larger and eventually turned into the Romance Languages that we know today.
And Latin? Well, that is una lengua muerta now.

So what I'm trying to say is, language is not a static thing. Don't be snooty
about it. Embrace change. And wouldn't it be cool if this all this increased
globalization somehow resulted in a universal creole language that everybody
can speak?
