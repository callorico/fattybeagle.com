I drove a fantastic stretch of Route 66 between Ash Fork and Seligman at dusk
yesterday. The old road began veering off from the interstate and the lights
and noise from the other cars slowly started to fade away as the sun finally
disappeared behind the hills with a flash of orange. There were no houses, no
other cars, no lights. Just me, the tiny civic, and the stars. High beams were
required in order to see the curves as the road slowly climbed and gently
winded its way though the hills. Just as I began to wonder if I had made a
wrong turn somewhere, the retro neon motel signs in Seligman appeared in the
distance.

At times like this, I can almost imagine what it must have been like to travel
this road back in the day. Then, as I glanced around at my ipod, cell phone,
and blue LED from the GPS unit sitting on my dash, I thought to myself, well,
maybe not.
