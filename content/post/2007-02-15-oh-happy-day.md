I think I may have managed to get the laptop hobbling along again. It seems to
work now after disabling the secondary IDE channel. Unfortunately, this means
the DVD drive is non-functional but I can live with that for now.

Speaking of which, I think I am willing to do without an optical drive on my
next laptop. I can't say I've used it much. I'm usually at home if I'm
installing something and I can just as easily share out the drive on my
desktop. However, I have this nagging suspicion that I will desperately need to
read a CD the moment I travel with a laptop sans drive.

No new pics though until I can find an access point that lets me upload at a
decent rate.
