In short: Granada is quite possibly the most difficult to navigate city I have
ever been in. This, of course, does not mix well with my poor sense of
direction. I have a couple of suggestions for the city planners:

  * Consider adding more than 3 street signs. It can rather difficult using a
    map at times when there are no signs at an intersection.
  * It would be nice if streets didn't change names after every block.

I kid, I kid. I really do like the city and I can find my way around OK now
(except in Albayzin because that barrio is seriously straight out of Doom). And
really, part of the charm of the city is wandering around some poorly lit alley
wondering if you are about to be mugged only to find an interesting flamenco
bar at the end of it.

My host family is nice and, as in Tenerife, single mom with a couple of kids. I
think she makes her money renting out rooms to students since I see her in a
bathrobe at all hours of the day. Currently there's me and 2 other American
girls going to a different school. There are 3 French teenagers arriving
sometime this weekend I think.

There is definitely a lot of energy in the city and that I'm sure is due in
large part to the huge numbers of students that live in the area. I am
definitely on the far right end of the age bell curve here.

And finally (man, this is one horrendously jumbled post which I suppose
somewhat matches the original theme of convoluted layouts), Granada is de puta
madre because of the free tapas. For every drink you order, you get a free
tapa. And, you get a better tapa with each drink! Somebody seriously needs to
start this in the States. I haven't quite worked out how they make money but
some MBA guy can figure that out later.
